If you saved them, you will find them at the Campsite.  \n\nArnell Hallowleaf Stats : \n\nArnell Hallowleaf General Information : Race: ??", "Shadowheart : Shadowheart is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3). BG3 Shadowheart can be rescued during the Nautiloid segment in Act 1, or found by the locked crypt door on the beach after crashing. Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party. However, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox. If Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.         \n\nWhere to find Shadowheart in BG3 : Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. ", "She will offer again to join your party, but if Lae'zel is present, convincing her will require a successful Persuasion check. This will begin the quest: Daughter of Darkness.Note: After you've acquired the Speak with Dead spell, you can go return to the Ravaged Beach and talk to the dead fishermen to learn more about Shadowheart.   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way. Shadowheart is of Acolyte background, so her inspiration boosts are: Fate Must Wait (Resurrect anyone in your party) *can be achieved regardless of chapter A Kiss Without Mercy (Endure the ritual of Loviatar until Abdirak is pleased).Divinity Undone (Unlock and read the Book of Dead Gods).Her Gift of Silver (Recover Sel\u00fbne's lost treasure through prayer) Tragic Love (Witness Jonas' funeral).Moonweaver's Prayer (Witness Isobel's Ritual to keep up the protection of Last Light)  \n\nShadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her. Make sure to check the Companion Approvals page to get her approvals.

This will begin the quest: Daughter of Darkness.Note: After you've acquired the Speak with Dead spell, you can go return to the Ravaged Beach and talk to the dead fishermen to learn more about Shadowheart.   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way. Shadowheart is of Acolyte background, so her inspiration boosts are: Fate Must Wait (Resurrect anyone in your party) *can be achieved regardless of chapter A Kiss Without Mercy (Endure the ritual of Loviatar until Abdirak is pleased).Divinity Undone (Unlock and read the Book of Dead Gods).Her Gift of Silver (Recover Sel\u00fbne's lost treasure through prayer) Tragic Love (Witness Jonas' funeral).Moonweaver's Prayer (Witness Isobel's Ritual to keep up the protection of Last Light)  \n\nShadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her.

Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party. However, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox. If Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.         \n\nWhere to find Shadowheart in BG3 : Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid.

BG3 Shadowheart can be rescued during the Nautiloid segment in Act 1, or found by the locked crypt door on the beach after crashing. Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party. However, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox. If Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.         \n\nWhere to find Shadowheart in BG3 : Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid.

The outcome of this interaction varies based on whether you accepted Raphael's contract or not. ", "Lae'zel : Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3). BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.   Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first. Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight. She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map. Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.     \n\nWhere to find Lae'Zel in BG3 : Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid.

This will begin his quest: The Githyanki Warrior   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light.

Moonrise Towers is my only lead.I\u2019m here on holiday.My intentions are my own.

You\u2019ll have an extra choice for dialogue here if you chose Background as a citizen of Baldur\u2019s Gate. Choosing it or asking her if she knows her will have her explain to you the stories of Jaheira\u2019s bravery.  NOTE: Some dialogue interactions will have additional options depending on the Background, Race or Class of your character.    Afterward, move forward and examine the runes on your right to activate the Waypoint for the Last Light Inn. Head down the path further in toward the opening at (X:51, Y:143) that leads to the actual inn. There will be a realistic bear statue on your left as you enter. Your character will do a Nature check as you enter to ascertain what it actually is. Head inside and find Jaheira at (X:67, Y:139) and talk to her. She\u2019ll propose a toast to your health.

It\u2019s changing me for the better.It\u2019s trying to change me, trying to win me over, but I\u2019m resisting its temptations.[SAVING THROW] Despite knowing you\u2019re under the effects of a drug, try to deny the tadpole has any influence over you.

", "Lae'zel : Lae'zel is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3). BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.   Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first. Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight. She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map. Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.     \n\nWhere to find Lae'Zel in BG3 : Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid.

You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest: The Githyanki Warrior   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. ", "Choosing the fourth choice and being successful will have her be satisfied with your answer, but explain why she has to be cautious. She will say that tracking the parasites led her to someone who should\u2019ve been dead for over a century. If you ask who it is, she\u2019ll reveal it to be General Ketheric Thorn, the leader of the Absolutist cult. It seems that not only is he not dead, he\u2019s also currently unkillable. They had an encounter with him as he and his army were marching to Baldur\u2019s Gate. Suffice it to say, he defeated them and had them chased all the way to this inn. However, she seems to have some hope in you. You can respond to this with the following choices: What do you have in mind?.You think I can kill him?.I don\u2019t think so. Her plan is to have you infiltrate his base as a True Soul and find out how to deactivate his invincibility. You\u2019ll have the following options to reply with: Ketheric\u2019s days are numbered. I\u2019ll make sure of it.You want to make use of my infection - I want to be cured of it.Seems like I\u2019ll be doing most of the heavy lifting.I\u2019m not doing this. Choosing the second option will have her explain that you\u2019ll probably find a means to cure yourself in the Moonrise Towers anyway. You can then ask her how to get there past the debilitating shadows. She\u2019ll explain that Isobel, a Cleric of Selune, protects the inn with her light, and will be the key that\u2019ll let you protect against the darkness. She bids you go upstairs at her recommendation.

Isobel\u2019s room is to the north but she\u2019s actually further along on another balcony, which you can reach through a door at (X:64, Y:168).

If you\u2019ve brought Shadowheart along with you, she\u2019ll get stung by the Spell, and ask her lady Shar for forgiveness.

You\u2019ll have the following options to react with: What are you?.Isobel, do you know this man?.I say we follow the winged freak.

We\u2019re going to need to fight our way out of this one.Say nothing.You\u2019re going to meet Ketheric - face-to-face. If you\u2019ve brought them along, Astarion will disapprove of the first option, while Shadowheart and Karlach will approve of it. Choosing it will reveal your allegiance. Marcus will let out a roar to call out more minions, and you\u2019ll enter a combat engagement. If you brought Shadowheart along she\u2019ll gain inspiration from having a Selunite spell cast on her. For this fight, you\u2019ll have to attempt to defeat Flaming Fist Marcus and six Winged Horrors. All of them are going to do their best to go straight of Isobel. Your best bet for a small chance of winning here is to use a protection spell on Isobel, while you dish out as much damage as you can on Marcus before he knocks Isobel out. Chances are, however, you\u2019ll lose this fight due to Marcus\u2019 sheer bulk and power. After he knocks out Isobel, all hell will break loose in the inn, resulting in the death of most of its inhabitants.  The shields will disappear, allowing the shadows to enter the inn and turn some into Enemies, while the others die to the horrors that enter. Outside, Jaheira will see the shields melt and ask you what happened. Choosing the first choice will have her restate your mission to figure out Ketheric\u2019s invincibility. Before you get out of here to do that though, you\u2019ll have to clear the area of allies turned to foes.

You can ask him if this task violates their contract, as he was supposed to be killing devils, not rescuing them. Knowing how Mizora thinks, however, he confirms that the contract doesn\u2019t say anything about saving a devil so the task still stands.

Hand it over.Thank you - let\u2019s go.Or I could kill you and take that light. Naturally, choosing the third option will result in a fight, but there\u2019s no telling if he\u2019ll give the lantern over anyway. Kar\u2019niss will likely start the fight with Sanctuary. If anyone in your party has Counterspell as a reaction, you can stop this. Otherwise, it\u2019s not a bad thing to let it happen as might want to take care of the Enemies with lower health points anyway. Thanks to your antics, you\u2019ll have to clear out the drider, two goblins, and two Half-Orcs. Kar\u2019niss has a massive amount of health, but you should be able to whittle him down easily especially once he\u2019s alone.  Looting him afterward will net you his Moonlantern and the Cruel Sting longsword. Taking the Moonlantern will reveal a pixie trapped inside that\u2019s responsible for the light that protects against even the deeper shadows.

Harper Mijah\u2019s on the eastern side of the building patrolling along the balcony. Isobel\u2019s room is to the north but she\u2019s actually further along on another balcony, which you can reach through a door at (X:64, Y:168). You\u2019ll see the shielding spell take its toll on her before she notices you. Choosing the first choice will have her express that she\u2019s full glad to have you as their little miracle against the darkness. She\u2019ll proceed to enchant you and your party with the same shield she\u2019s cast around the inn but will warn you that it won\u2019t be enough to protect you when you reach the depths of the Shadow-Cursed Lands, though it should be enough to reach Moonrise Towers. If you\u2019ve brought Shadowheart along with you, she\u2019ll get stung by the Spell, and ask her lady Shar for forgiveness. As she gives you advice on how to best Ketheric, you get interrupted by Flaming Fist Marcus, a former brave ally of theirs, now turned by the Enemy in exchange for a pair of wings. You\u2019ll have the following options to react with: What are you?.Isobel, do you know this man?.I say we follow the winged freak. After she introduces him to you, he\u2019ll reveal himself as a True Soul and try to telepathically order you to take Isobel back to their home base. You\u2019ll have the following options to respond with: [WISDOM] Probe his thoughts for more information.What does he want with her?.Sounds like fun - I\u2019m with you.I\u2019m not like you - I don\u2019t take orders from the Absolute\u2019s cronies.Touch her and I\u2019ll kill you. Choosing the first option and passing the Wisdom check will allow you to see Ketheric give the order to Marcus. Isobel will question your telepathic interaction, to which you\u2019ll have the following options to respond with: Marcus is trying to kidnap you, Isobel. We\u2019re going to need to fight our way out of this one.Say nothing.You\u2019re going to meet Ketheric - face-to-face. If you\u2019ve brought them along, Astarion will disapprove of the first option, while Shadowheart and Karlach will approve of it. Choosing it will reveal your allegiance. Marcus will let out a roar to call out more minions, and you\u2019ll enter a combat engagement. If you brought Shadowheart along she\u2019ll gain inspiration from having a Selunite spell cast on her. For this fight, you\u2019ll have to attempt to defeat Flaming Fist Marcus and six Winged Horrors. All of them are going to do their best to go straight of Isobel. Your best bet for a small chance of winning here is to use a protection spell on Isobel, while you dish out as much damage as you can on Marcus before he knocks Isobel out. Chances are, however, you\u2019ll lose this fight due to Marcus\u2019 sheer bulk and power. After he knocks out Isobel, all hell will break loose in the inn, resulting in the death of most of its inhabitants.  The shields will disappear, allowing the shadows to enter the inn and turn some into Enemies, while the others die to the horrors that enter. Outside, Jaheira will see the shields melt and ask you what happened. Choosing the first choice will have her restate your mission to figure out Ketheric\u2019s invincibility. Before you get out of here to do that though, you\u2019ll have to clear the area of allies turned to foes. This won\u2019t be difficult by any means, other than the fact that they used to be innocents. There\u2019ll be another group waiting for you on the bridge to the southeast, which is also bring in some Creepers.  After the fight, loot as much as you need and then proceed back to the bridge at (X:-11, Y: 120) to head back to the Ruined Battlefield.  \n\nReturn to the Ruined Battlefield : After crossing the bridge, head straight ahead to the path at (X:11, Y:9), toward the southeast.

If you choose the fifth option, Mol will intervene and vouch for you. Jaheira will then question how you could have a tadpole but not be a thrall. You\u2019ll have the following choices to answer the question: Because of this artefact. (Show Jaheira).I work in mysterious ways.You\u2019ll just have to take my word for it.Attack Karlach will approve of the first option. The tadpole she has will react negatively to the artefact as you take it out.

Here\u2019s hoping you agree.Your guess is as good as mine. ", "If you choose the first option, they\u2019ll finally ease up on you and ask why you\u2019re there. You\u2019ll have the following options to reply with: To destroy the Absolute in its lair: Moonrise Towers.I just want a cure for the parasite in my head. Moonrise Towers is my only lead.I\u2019m here on holiday.My intentions are my own. Choosing the second option will finally have them let you off to your own devices, before inviting you for a drink in the inn. Karlach will have an exclamation point over her here if you brought her along. If you talk to her she\u2019ll fangirl over Jaheira. You\u2019ll have an extra choice for dialogue here if you chose Background as a citizen of Baldur\u2019s Gate. Choosing it or asking her if she knows her will have her explain to you the stories of Jaheira\u2019s bravery.

She\u2019s very excited to meet you.I\u2019m not thirsty.  If you choose the second option and pass the Medicine check, you\u2019ll discover that she\u2019s laced the drink with an herb that acts like a truth serum. You\u2019ll have the option to express your trust wavering as a result afterward, but then you\u2019ll still have to choose whether you\u2019ll drink it or not. Drinking it will gain disapproval from Astarion and Shadowheart, but will gain approval from fangirl Karlach, if you\u2019ve brought any of them with you. Jaheira will then ask if the parasite is affecting you or not. You\u2019ll have the following choices to answer the question with: I see now why you\u2019ve spiked my wine.Yes. The parasite is giving me powers I never had before. It\u2019s changing me for the better.It\u2019s trying to change me, trying to win me over, but I\u2019m resisting its temptations.[SAVING THROW] Despite knowing you\u2019re under the effects of a drug, try to deny the tadpole has any influence over you. The first option will just have her press you for a different answer. ", "Choosing the fourth choice and being successful will have her be satisfied with your answer, but explain why she has to be cautious. She will say that tracking the parasites led her to someone who should\u2019ve been dead for over a century. If you ask who it is, she\u2019ll reveal it to be General Ketheric Thorn, the leader of the Absolutist cult. It seems that not only is he not dead, he\u2019s also currently unkillable. They had an encounter with him as he and his army were marching to Baldur\u2019s Gate. Suffice it to say, he defeated them and had them chased all the way to this inn. However, she seems to have some hope in you. You can respond to this with the following choices: What do you have in mind?.You think I can kill him?.I don\u2019t think so. Her plan is to have you infiltrate his base as a True Soul and find out how to deactivate his invincibility. You\u2019ll have the following options to reply with: Ketheric\u2019s days are numbered. I\u2019ll make sure of it.You want to make use of my infection - I want to be cured of it.Seems like I\u2019ll be doing most of the heavy lifting.I\u2019m not doing this. Choosing the second option will have her explain that you\u2019ll probably find a means to cure yourself in the Moonrise Towers anyway. You can then ask her how to get there past the debilitating shadows. She\u2019ll explain that Isobel, a Cleric of Selune, protects the inn with her light, and will be the key that\u2019ll let you protect against the darkness.

This will begin the quest: Daughter of Darkness.Note: After you've acquired the Speak with Dead spell, you can go return to the Ravaged Beach and talk to the dead fishermen to learn more about Shadowheart.   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way. Shadowheart is of Acolyte background, so her inspiration boosts are: Fate Must Wait (Resurrect anyone in your party) *can be achieved regardless of chapter A Kiss Without Mercy (Endure the ritual of Loviatar until Abdirak is pleased).Divinity Undone (Unlock and read the Book of Dead Gods).Her Gift of Silver (Recover Sel\u00fbne's lost treasure through prayer) Tragic Love (Witness Jonas' funeral).Moonweaver's Prayer (Witness Isobel's Ritual to keep up the protection of Last Light)  \n\nShadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her. Make sure to check the Companion Approvals page to get her approvals. ", "If you choose that option, it\u2019ll seem to wholeheartedly agree to it. Asking about the mechanism will have it claim that it\u2019s dangerous for her to even talk about it. If you choose to release it, you\u2019ll gain approval from Astarion and Karlach if you brought them along. She\u2019ll then ask how she can repay you, and you\u2019ll have the following options to answer with: I need to get through this shadow curse. Can you help?.What\u2019s on offer?.Nothing - my help doesn\u2019t come with strings attached. Choosing the first option will have her toy with you for a bit but ultimately give you a magic bell, called the Filigreed Feywild Bell, that you can ring for the protection you asked for. Continue looting as necessary. One of the goblins will have some Thermoarcanic Gloves you can cop. Note that the pixie already has you blessed so there\u2019s no need to actually use the bell yet. There\u2019s a locked chest on the southwest side of the house that you can lockpick, or you can get the key for it on the roof, which you can get to with the ladder. Depending on whether or not you\u2019ve got Wyll in your party if you rest at camp now, Mizora will come for a visit. She\u2019ll tell you that one of Zariel\u2019s devils has been captured by the cultists and brought to Moonrise Towers. Wyll\u2019s next task, as per their pact, is to free this devil. You\u2019ll have the following options to respond to this with: And this is our problem how, exactly?.Forget it. This \u2018asset\u2019 can rot in the Towers for all I care.If this devil is so powerful, how did they manage to get captured? If you choose the first option, she\u2019ll do her usual referencing of their contract. Before she leaves, you\u2019ll do a Perception check here to see if she\u2019s hiding anything behind her usual attitude, and blurry appearance.  If you did choose to take a long rest, you\u2019ll be visited by your Dream Visitor again as you sleep.

Clicking it will reveal another hidden room behind the wall. Inside will be two Armored Chests with some scrolls and potions.  Head all the way back to where you landed upon entering the hatch. ", "If you pass it, you\u2019ll find the True Love\u2019s Caress among the pile of bones nearby. There are Grated Iron Doors to the north that you can lockpick with 10 DC. Inside is a sarcophagus hiding the Boots of Apparent Death. There\u2019s another chamber to the north with two sarcophagi inside, containing the Icebite Robe and some minor items. If you head out and continue your journey to the west from here, you\u2019ll find the door to the House of Healing. If you ignore the door and head north you\u2019ll come across some Dark Justiciar corpses. Continue along the path to eventually find Raphael. He\u2019ll start you off with a warning in the form of a rhyme, to which you can call out his worry over you. Afterward, you can ask him what dangers he\u2019s warning you about. If you ask him for specifics, he\u2019ll explain that there\u2019s an ancient demon ahead lost to time, and approaching them risks awakening their plague onto the world if you don\u2019t manage to kill it. If you want him to be more specific, you can try to pass a Persuasion check. Afterward, you can do an Insight check to see if he\u2019s hiding anything else from you. Upon further probing, you\u2019ll learn that it\u2019s an Orthon you\u2019re after. Telling him that he\u2019s afraid of this target will have him warn you not to underestimate it. Finally, he\u2019ll assure you that he hasn\u2019t forgotten his end of the bargain about translating the scars on Astarion\u2019s back. Behind him, to the southwest is the entrance to the Grand Mausoleum.   \n\nGrand Mausoleum : After entering, when you go through the iron fence, you\u2019ll hear a talking skull telling you to beat it, but it won\u2019t do anything else if you interact with it. A part of Ketheric Thorm\u2019s diary sits near his diseased wife\u2019s coffin. Other parts as scattered around this area if you want to look into his past. In the eastern area of this first area, you can find a locked Traveller\u2019s Chest at (X:-259, Y:-882). It has a lockpicking DC of 14 and contains the Vivacious Cloak, some alchemy materials, some valuables, and possibly a potion or two.  Loot the rest of the area as much as you\u2019d like, and then head over to the northern section. The plaque here reveals that Isobel is Ketheric\u2019s daughter and that the tomb here belonged to her. Successful Perception checks here will reveal traps on the vents and various tiles on the floor, as well as gargoyle heads on the walls, all around the room. To move forward from here, you\u2019ll have to press the buttons below the three paintings around the room in the right order. Start with the button below the Moonrise Towers painting first, and then the Grief painting beside it, before finally pressing the last button under Ketheric Thorm\u2019s painting. Getting the order correctly will open up the walls beside the last painting and allow you to pass through. Interact with the Traversal Gem here to travel down and get to the Gauntlet of Shar.   \n\nGauntlet of Shar : Once you've reached the Gauntlet of Shar, continue heading north and go through the first Stone Door to enter the first chamber. In this area, there is a small statue holding an orb.

Down here, head up the stairs to the left to circle around the room. At the end of the room, a successful Perception check will reveal a Keyholed Herald on the wall. You can either lockpick the keyhole or use a Tower-Shaped key to open a path in the wall. Follow the path to a Reinforced Gilded Chest.

The table to your immediate right should have a Barkskin Recipe for you to read. If you move forward, there\u2019ll be a pile of bones on top of some concrete. Investigating the plaque below it will inspire you if you had picked the Guild Artisan Background. Head through the door past it to the north and then head to the west side to find an Ornate Wooden Hatch. Enter it to enter the Masons' Guild.  Down here, head up the stairs to the left to circle around the room. At the end of the room, a successful Perception check will reveal a Keyholed Herald on the wall. You can either lockpick the keyhole or use a Tower-Shaped key to open a path in the wall. Follow the path to a Reinforced Gilded Chest. Another successful Perception check will reveal that it\u2019s trapped, but don\u2019t bother \u2018cause it\u2019s empty. Move forward and go through the wooden doors to a large chamber with a dining table. Exploring this area will put you in a combat engagement against five Shadows led by a Wraith. The fight shouldn\u2019t be too hard, but be wary of the Wraith. At the southern end of the hall is another Gilded Chest that\u2019s trapped. Its disarming DC is 21, and its lockpicking DC is 14. It should contain the Helmet of Arcane Acuity. On the east side of the chamber on the upper level is a button you can only find by passing the Perception check. Clicking it will reveal another hidden room behind the wall. Inside will be two Armored Chests with some scrolls and potions.  Head all the way back to where you landed upon entering the hatch. ", "If you choose that option, it\u2019ll seem to wholeheartedly agree to it. Asking about the mechanism will have it claim that it\u2019s dangerous for her to even talk about it. If you choose to release it, you\u2019ll gain approval from Astarion and Karlach if you brought them along. She\u2019ll then ask how she can repay you, and you\u2019ll have the following options to answer with: I need to get through this shadow curse. Can you help?.What\u2019s on offer?.Nothing - my help doesn\u2019t come with strings attached. Choosing the first option will have her toy with you for a bit but ultimately give you a magic bell, called the Filigreed Feywild Bell, that you can ring for the protection you asked for. Continue looting as necessary. One of the goblins will have some Thermoarcanic Gloves you can cop. Note that the pixie already has you blessed so there\u2019s no need to actually use the bell yet. There\u2019s a locked chest on the southwest side of the house that you can lockpick, or you can get the key for it on the roof, which you can get to with the ladder. Depending on whether or not you\u2019ve got Wyll in your party if you rest at camp now, Mizora will come for a visit. She\u2019ll tell you that one of Zariel\u2019s devils has been captured by the cultists and brought to Moonrise Towers. Wyll\u2019s next task, as per their pact, is to free this devil. You\u2019ll have the following options to respond to this with: And this is our problem how, exactly?.Forget it. This \u2018asset\u2019 can rot in the Towers for all I care.If this devil is so powerful, how did they manage to get captured? If you choose the first option, she\u2019ll do her usual referencing of their contract. Before she leaves, you\u2019ll do a Perception check here to see if she\u2019s hiding anything behind her usual attitude, and blurry appearance.  If you did choose to take a long rest, you\u2019ll be visited by your Dream Visitor again as you sleep. They\u2019ll comment on how strong the Absolute\u2019s influence is where you are, and then commend you for saving the refugees at the grove.

A cutscene will ensue as you watch some cultist pass by, led by the drider Kar\u2019niss. One of them will notice you in the shadows who yells at you to reveal yourself. You\u2019ll have the following options to react: Clear your throat to make yourself known.Stay hidden, keep watching.Attack! If you choose to stay hidden, there\u2019ll be an internal squabble, resulting in Kar\u2019niss slaughtering the goblin that noticed you, so you\u2019ll have one less to kill. After that, you can either clear your throat and reveal yourself, or do a Stealth check to wait for them to pass. Choosing the first option will have the drider recognize you as a True Soul and ask how you\u2019ve survived the shadows without protection. As per your current objective of finding the answer to the same question, you can ask him in return how he has survived thus far. He\u2019ll reveal that the lantern he carries is the key. You\u2019ll then have the following courses of action to choose from: [INTIMIDATION] The Absolute has asked me to carry the lantern. Hand it over.Thank you - let\u2019s go.Or I could kill you and take that light. Naturally, choosing the third option will result in a fight, but there\u2019s no telling if he\u2019ll give the lantern over anyway. Kar\u2019niss will likely start the fight with Sanctuary. If anyone in your party has Counterspell as a reaction, you can stop this. Otherwise, it\u2019s not a bad thing to let it happen as might want to take care of the Enemies with lower health points anyway. Thanks to your antics, you\u2019ll have to clear out the drider, two goblins, and two Half-Orcs. Kar\u2019niss has a massive amount of health, but you should be able to whittle him down easily especially once he\u2019s alone.  Looting him afterward will net you his Moonlantern and the Cruel Sting longsword. Taking the Moonlantern will reveal a pixie trapped inside that\u2019s responsible for the light that protects against even the deeper shadows. A successful Intelligence check will tell you that they can be playful and even malicious. Dolly Dolly Dolly, the pixie will claim that she\u2019s in constant pain inside the lantern as it\u2019s the only way to get the light shining constantly. You\u2019ll have the following options to respond with: Who are you?.You\u2019re fuel for the lantern? How does that work?.What\u2019s this mechanism at the base of the lantern?.Release the pixie.Ignore the pixie. You\u2019ll be needing this lamp. Choosing the first option will have the pixie formally introduce itself as Dolly Dolly Dolly, and ask you to free her. Afterward, the first option will be replaced by a proposal to help you travel through the shadows in exchange for freeing her. ", "Choosing the fourth choice and being successful will have her be satisfied with your answer, but explain why she has to be cautious. She will say that tracking the parasites led her to someone who should\u2019ve been dead for over a century. If you ask who it is, she\u2019ll reveal it to be General Ketheric Thorn, the leader of the Absolutist cult. It seems that not only is he not dead, he\u2019s also currently unkillable. They had an encounter with him as he and his army were marching to Baldur\u2019s Gate. Suffice it to say, he defeated them and had them chased all the way to this inn. However, she seems to have some hope in you. You can respond to this with the following choices: What do you have in mind?.You think I can kill him?.I don\u2019t think so. Her plan is to have you infiltrate his base as a True Soul and find out how to deactivate his invincibility. You\u2019ll have the following options to reply with: Ketheric\u2019s days are numbered. I\u2019ll make sure of it.You want to make use of my infection - I want to be cured of it.Seems like I\u2019ll be doing most of the heavy lifting.I\u2019m not doing this. Choosing the second option will have her explain that you\u2019ll probably find a means to cure yourself in the Moonrise Towers anyway. You can then ask her how to get there past the debilitating shadows. She\u2019ll explain that Isobel, a Cleric of Selune, protects the inn with her light, and will be the key that\u2019ll let you protect against the darkness. She bids you go upstairs at her recommendation.  ", "They needed my help.It doesn\u2019t seem like my help did them much good. The cultists caught up with them.It was a waste of time. I regret it now.I didn\u2019t do it for them. The goblins were in my way, so I killed them. Choosing the first option will have them say it\u2019s not a choice just anyone could make, before wincing in pain. A successful Perception check will tell you that they\u2019re hiding their struggle to protect you. You\u2019ll have the following options to react with: What is it?.Are you all right?.Focus! Don\u2019t you dare drop my protection.Say nothing. A successful Insight check this time will tell you that despite her disciplined, strong demeanor, she also needs some comfort. You can choose to do the following: Say nothing. Wait.Hold (them) tight.You look terrible. Do you need a hug?.Pull yourself together. We\u2019ve got work to do. They\u2019ll appreciate the gesture if you choose to hold them and mention that it\u2019s been quite a while since they\u2019ve been held by someone. If you ask them who it was that used to hold them, they\u2019ll reveal the name Belynne who they were very close to. They\u2019ll tell you how the Absolute\u2019s mental attacks to transform you have been relentless, but they\u2019ll reaffirm her resolve to protect you for as long as they can. Before leaving camp, you can talk to Wyll who\u2019ll be quite pissed at his new task. You can ask him if this task violates their contract, as he was supposed to be killing devils, not rescuing them. Knowing how Mizora thinks, however, he confirms that the contract doesn\u2019t say anything about saving a devil so the task still stands. You can continue the conversation which will end with the resolution to complete the task so he doesn\u2019t get turned into a lemure. Back to the ruined house where you fought the drider, head to the southeast, and turn left at (X:31, Y:-13). You\u2019ll pass by another house with a chest containing a book and some valuables.

Be careful going in, as a successful Perception check will reveal an explosive trap at the entrance. Inside, there should be a locked Traveler\u2019s Chest under the shelf among the pots, with a lockpicking DC of 10, containing a Ring of Twilight.

If you choose to stay hidden, there\u2019ll be an internal squabble, resulting in Kar\u2019niss slaughtering the goblin that noticed you, so you\u2019ll have one less to kill. After that, you can either clear your throat and reveal yourself, or do a Stealth check to wait for them to pass. Choosing the first option will have the drider recognize you as a True Soul and ask how you\u2019ve survived the shadows without protection. As per your current objective of finding the answer to the same question, you can ask him in return how he has survived thus far. He\u2019ll reveal that the lantern he carries is the key.

Naturally, choosing the third option will result in a fight, but there\u2019s no telling if he\u2019ll give the lantern over anyway. Kar\u2019niss will likely start the fight with Sanctuary. If anyone in your party has Counterspell as a reaction, you can stop this. Otherwise, it\u2019s not a bad thing to let it happen as might want to take care of the Enemies with lower health points anyway. Thanks to your antics, you\u2019ll have to clear out the drider, two goblins, and two Half-Orcs. Kar\u2019niss has a massive amount of health, but you should be able to whittle him down easily especially once he\u2019s alone.

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way. Shadowheart is of Acolyte background, so her inspiration boosts are: Fate Must Wait (Resurrect anyone in your party) *can be achieved regardless of chapter A Kiss Without Mercy (Endure the ritual of Loviatar until Abdirak is pleased).Divinity Undone (Unlock and read the Book of Dead Gods).Her Gift of Silver (Recover Sel\u00fbne's lost treasure through prayer) Tragic Love (Witness Jonas' funeral).Moonweaver's Prayer (Witness Isobel's Ritual to keep up the protection of Last Light)  \n\nShadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her.

Moonrise Towers is my only lead.I\u2019m here on holiday.My intentions are my own. Choosing the second option will finally have them let you off to your own devices, before inviting you for a drink in the inn.

You\u2019ll have an extra choice for dialogue here if you chose Background as a citizen of Baldur\u2019s Gate. Choosing it or asking her if she knows her will have her explain to you the stories of Jaheira\u2019s bravery.

BG3 Lae'Zel can be met while escaping the Nautiloid. She is a Githyanki Fighter and a great addition to your party as a martial class with high DPS and possible Tanking. See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.   Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first. Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight. She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map. Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces. If Lae'zel dies on the Nautiloid and you don't resurrect her then you can find her dead about 35 meters ahead of where you land on the shore and you're unable to revive her then.     \n\nWhere to find Lae'Zel in BG3 : Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light.

This will begin the quest: Daughter of Darkness.Note: After you've acquired the Speak with Dead spell, you can go return to the Ravaged Beach and talk to the dead fishermen to learn more about Shadowheart.   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way. Shadowheart is of Acolyte background, so her inspiration boosts are: Fate Must Wait (Resurrect anyone in your party) *can be achieved regardless of chapter A Kiss Without Mercy (Endure the ritual of Loviatar until Abdirak is pleased).Divinity Undone (Unlock and read the Book of Dead Gods).Her Gift of Silver (Recover Sel\u00fbne's lost treasure through prayer) Tragic Love (Witness Jonas' funeral).Moonweaver's Prayer (Witness Isobel's Ritual to keep up the protection of Last Light)  \n\nShadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her.

After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late.

This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good.

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way. Shadowheart is of Acolyte background, so her inspiration boosts are: Fate Must Wait (Resurrect anyone in your party) *can be achieved regardless of chapter A Kiss Without Mercy (Endure the ritual of Loviatar until Abdirak is pleased).Divinity Undone (Unlock and read the Book of Dead Gods).Her Gift of Silver (Recover Sel\u00fbne's lost treasure through prayer) Tragic Love (Witness Jonas' funeral).Moonweaver's Prayer (Witness Isobel's Ritual to keep up the protection of Last Light)  \n\nShadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her. Make sure to check the Companion Approvals page to get her approvals. ", "Choosing the fourth choice and being successful will have her be satisfied with your answer, but explain why she has to be cautious. She will say that tracking the parasites led her to someone who should\u2019ve been dead for over a century. If you ask who it is, she\u2019ll reveal it to be General Ketheric Thorn, the leader of the Absolutist cult. It seems that not only is he not dead, he\u2019s also currently unkillable. They had an encounter with him as he and his army were marching to Baldur\u2019s Gate. Suffice it to say, he defeated them and had them chased all the way to this inn. However, she seems to have some hope in you. You can respond to this with the following choices: What do you have in mind?.You think I can kill him?.I don\u2019t think so. Her plan is to have you infiltrate his base as a True Soul and find out how to deactivate his invincibility. You\u2019ll have the following options to reply with: Ketheric\u2019s days are numbered. I\u2019ll make sure of it.You want to make use of my infection - I want to be cured of it.Seems like I\u2019ll be doing most of the heavy lifting.I\u2019m not doing this. Choosing the second option will have her explain that you\u2019ll probably find a means to cure yourself in the Moonrise Towers anyway. You can then ask her how to get there past the debilitating shadows. She\u2019ll explain that Isobel, a Cleric of Selune, protects the inn with her light, and will be the key that\u2019ll let you protect against the darkness. She bids you go upstairs at her recommendation.

Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way. Shadowheart is of Acolyte background, so her inspiration boosts are: Fate Must Wait (Resurrect anyone in your party) *can be achieved regardless of chapter A Kiss Without Mercy (Endure the ritual of Loviatar until Abdirak is pleased).Divinity Undone (Unlock and read the Book of Dead Gods).Her Gift of Silver (Recover Sel\u00fbne's lost treasure through prayer) Tragic Love (Witness Jonas' funeral).Moonweaver's Prayer (Witness Isobel's Ritual to keep up the protection of Last Light)  \n\nShadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her.

This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified.

BG3 Shadowheart can be rescued during the Nautiloid segment in Act 1, or found by the locked crypt door on the beach after crashing. Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party.

When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way. Shadowheart is of Acolyte background, so her inspiration boosts are: Fate Must Wait (Resurrect anyone in your party) *can be achieved regardless of chapter A Kiss Without Mercy (Endure the ritual of Loviatar until Abdirak is pleased).Divinity Undone (Unlock and read the Book of Dead Gods).Her Gift of Silver (Recover Sel\u00fbne's lost treasure through prayer) Tragic Love (Witness Jonas' funeral).Moonweaver's Prayer (Witness Isobel's Ritual to keep up the protection of Last Light)  \n\nShadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her. Make sure to check the Companion Approvals page to get her approvals. ", "Shadowheart : Shadowheart is a Companion in Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3). BG3 Shadowheart can be rescued during the Nautiloid segment in Act 1, or found by the locked crypt door on the beach after crashing. Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party. However, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox. If Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.         \n\nWhere to find Shadowheart in BG3 : Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby.

Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party. However, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox. If Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.", "Where to find Arnell Hallowleaf : Can be found at: Act 3 The Chamber of Loss, House of Grief  \n\nArnell Hallowleaf Related Quests : Daughter of Darkness  \n\nArnell Hallowleaf Dialogue Options : Arnell Hallowleaf is one of the two prisoners inside the Chamber of Loss who become part of Shadowheart's trial is she is still aligned with Shar.

As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.", "BG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further.

After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want. What a softie.\n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act III : To be updated when more information is available.", "How to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance."], "mode": {"py/id": 8}, "metric_dict": {"mrr": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, "hit_rate": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["retrieved_texts", "query", "expected_texts", "mode", "metric_dict", "expected_ids", "retrieved_ids"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.base.RetrievalEvalResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"query": "Based on the context information provided, here is a question that could be used for a quiz or examination:", "expected_ids": ["208f38d6-51f7-42a9-8124-684f59921644"], "expected_texts": null, "retrieved_ids": ["51950155-cf1b-4319-b3be-f6e2b28af433", "cc1f96ea-205d-4fb5-8a6f-edb83164d85c", "a545caeb-de9a-418d-a268-e7c9ecfcb778"], "retrieved_texts": ["ur character will do a Nature check as you enter to ascertain what it actually is.

BG3 Shadowheart can be rescued during the Nautiloid segment in Act 1, or found by the locked crypt door on the beach after crashing. Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party. However, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox. If Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.", "Shadowheart Tips and Notes : This build centers on healing synergies and buffs for the party while rounding out Shadowheart's laughable intelligence.

This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.", "you'll need to pass another Charisma check with DC 14.

This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.", "BG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past.

At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger.

Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.", "How to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.", "gerous for her to even talk about it.

Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter.

As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it."], "mode": {"py/id": 8}, "metric_dict": {"mrr": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, "hit_rate": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["retrieved_texts", "query", "expected_texts", "mode", "metric_dict", "expected_ids", "retrieved_ids"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.base.RetrievalEvalResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"query": "\"Based on the context information, describe the steps you would take to reach the Ruined Battlefield Waypoint starting from the house with the chest, and explain how you would then get to the ruined storehouse.\"", "expected_ids": ["f071ce53-09c6-4035-9553-03277d23ef90"], "expected_texts": null, "retrieved_ids": ["f071ce53-09c6-4035-9553-03277d23ef90", "36628004-d9e0-4312-9b27-490d27cd53c7", "7ac5bee9-eb2b-4e39-8378-e299ba28565e"], "retrieved_texts": ["e southeast, and turn left at (X:31, Y:-13).

As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.", "ull glad to have you as their little miracle against the darkness.

As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.", "BG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.", "Shadowheart Endings Guide : \n\nSHADOWHEART SPARES THE NIGHTSONG AND BETRAYS HER LADY SHAR : Keep the Nightsong alive Kill Balthazar.Spare the Nightsong.Choose options that will persuade Shadowheart to let the Nightsong live\n\nRESULTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THE NIGHTSONG : If you remain supportive of Shadowheart and continue becoming her lover, there is a good chance that you will advance your romance with her.

As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past.

This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good.

BG3 Shadowheart can be rescued during the Nautiloid segment in Act 1, or found by the locked crypt door on the beach after crashing. Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party. However, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox. If Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.", "How to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.", "BG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up.

BG3 Shadowheart can be rescued during the Nautiloid segment in Act 1, or found by the locked crypt door on the beach after crashing. Shadowheart is a Half-Elf and a Trickery Domain Cleric, which gives your party heals, buffs and interesting stealth and deception spells. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.  A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.   One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover. Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid. The pod can be unlocked by finding and placing a particular rune in the console nearby. Certain classes may have the option to bypass the need for the rune. She will then offer to accompany you to the helm. Once you exit the Nautiloid, you will find her unconscious on the Ravaged Beach nearby. She will thank you for freeing her earlier, and offer to join your party. However, if you visit the camp, trigger a fight, or find a waypoint before waking her, she will move on to the Druid Grove. She can be found sitting on a stone next to the Strange Ox. If Shadowheart is not freed from her pod on the Nautiloid, then she can be found at the entrance of the Dank Crypt (Abandoned Ruins) at the northern end of the Ravaged Beach, where she will offer to join your party.", "Where to find Shadowheart in BG3 : Shadowheart can be freed from a pod during the prologue (Patch 5 and later) while you are aboard the Nautiloid.

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED", "How to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further.

Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect.

At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself.

This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.", "BG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger.

Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship."], "mode": {"py/id": 8}, "metric_dict": {"mrr": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, "hit_rate": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["retrieved_texts", "query", "expected_texts", "mode", "metric_dict", "expected_ids", "retrieved_ids"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.base.RetrievalEvalResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"query": "Based on the context information provided, here is a question that could be used for a quiz or examination:", "expected_ids": ["be65b334-2c48-4ead-afcd-042673332223"], "expected_texts": null, "retrieved_ids": ["1f3d40cc-7c83-47b3-a89e-cdb461325d42", "1a270c2c-29bb-4aab-b958-d8b367f9e930", "b438810f-d5f3-45ab-9610-db1a8692ff16"], "retrieved_texts": ["ave the following options to respond with: I am not\u2026 a True Soul\u2026.Look to the Harpers you saved.Accept your fate.[STRENGTH] Rage against the vines.[WARLOCK] Beseech your patron to help you.

Talk to Lae'zel, she I'll say she wants to speak with Kith'rak Voss at Sharess' Caress. Voss can be found inside a room on the third floor of Sharess' Caress next to Raphael. Once Voss leaves the room, starts the new Deal with the DevilQuest (This doesn't deviate us from our main mission).Once we finish Raphael's Quest, we meet Voss again on the second floor of Sharess' Caress. The outcome of this interaction varies based on whether you accepted Raphael's contract or not. If you agree to Raphael's terms and sign the contract, he'll drop the Orphic Hammer. Presenting it to Voss and agreeing to liberate Orpheus will conclude the quest, earning you the Silver Sword of the Astral Plane.Refusing Raphael's Contract: Declining the contract doesn't preclude obtaining the hammer, albeit through a significantly more challenging route. You must infiltrate Raphael's House of Hope, his residence, and steal the hammer. However, this entails confronting and defeating Raphael, widely regarded as one of the toughest adversaries in the game. Instructions on accessing the House of Hope are provided below.Meet Voss at The Sewers and show him the hammer, and if you signed Raphael's contract, the interaction proceeds similarly as before, resulting in the acquisition of the Silver Sword.  \n\n How to unlock Help Kith'rak Voss : Rivington  \n\nHelp Kith'rak Voss Rewards : Orphic Hammer.Silver Sword of the Astral Plane  \n\nHelp Kith'rak Voss Notes & Tips : Notes & tips go here"], "mode": {"py/id": 8}, "metric_dict": {"mrr": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, "hit_rate": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["retrieved_texts", "query", "expected_texts", "mode", "metric_dict", "expected_ids", "retrieved_ids"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.base.RetrievalEvalResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"query": "Based on the provided context information, here is a question for the upcoming quiz/examination:", "expected_ids": ["935cb376-91b9-4435-a7ff-c1d6599ade0c"], "expected_texts": null, "retrieved_ids": ["6497ad89-9a13-4293-b7fc-cc3c35a3df96", "1f3d40cc-7c83-47b3-a89e-cdb461325d42", "b438810f-d5f3-45ab-9610-db1a8692ff16"], "retrieved_texts": ["od as mine.

The outcome of this interaction varies based on whether you accepted Raphael's contract or not. If you agree to Raphael's terms and sign the contract, he'll drop the Orphic Hammer. Presenting it to Voss and agreeing to liberate Orpheus will conclude the quest, earning you the Silver Sword of the Astral Plane.Refusing Raphael's Contract: Declining the contract doesn't preclude obtaining the hammer, albeit through a significantly more challenging route. You must infiltrate Raphael's House of Hope, his residence, and steal the hammer. However, this entails confronting and defeating Raphael, widely regarded as one of the toughest adversaries in the game. Instructions on accessing the House of Hope are provided below.Meet Voss at The Sewers and show him the hammer, and if you signed Raphael's contract, the interaction proceeds similarly as before, resulting in the acquisition of the Silver Sword.  \n\n How to unlock Help Kith'rak Voss : Rivington  \n\nHelp Kith'rak Voss Rewards : Orphic Hammer.Silver Sword of the Astral Plane  \n\nHelp Kith'rak Voss Notes & Tips : Notes & tips go here", "Consider Gortash's Bargain : Consider Gortash's Bargain is a Quest in Baldur's Gate 3.

They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.

While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover.

As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way.

You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest: The Githyanki Warrior   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II : During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - \"source of my bruises\" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want.

Afterward, if you tell her you\u2019ll find her parents, you\u2019ll gain approval from Karlach and Shadowheart. Shadowheart will also approve of allowing her to stay at your camp. Move forward to the northeast for a Perception check. If you pass it, you\u2019ll find the True Love\u2019s Caress among the pile of bones nearby. There are Grated Iron Doors to the north that you can lockpick with 10 DC. Inside is a sarcophagus hiding the Boots of Apparent Death. There\u2019s another chamber to the north with two sarcophagi inside, containing the Icebite Robe and some minor items. If you head out and continue your journey to the west from here, you\u2019ll find the door to the House of Healing.

If you want him to be more specific, you can try to pass a Persuasion check. Afterward, you can do an Insight check to see if he\u2019s hiding anything else from you. Upon further probing, you\u2019ll learn that it\u2019s an Orthon you\u2019re after. Telling him that he\u2019s afraid of this target will have him warn you not to underestimate it.

As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II : During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - \"source of my bruises\" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want.

You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest: The Githyanki Warrior   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II : During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - \"source of my bruises\" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want.

However, she will no longer be able to join your party.If you arrive at Act 2 with her having stopped being a valid party member, then she will wander the Trielta Crags, and when you talk with her she will encourage you to visit the Creche. After moving on to the Shadowed Battlefield, she can be found near the entrance path from the monastery having been killed by necrotic damage (either the drider or the shadow creatures) with all gear plus some basic items on her body.", "How to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access.

At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect.

By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it.

See The Githyanki Warrior for Lae'Zel's Questline. Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment, but you can change their classes via Respec in camp. Companions can also be selected as an Origin in the Character Creation screen allowing players to play from their point of view.   Lae'zel is a consummate warrior, ferocious even by the standards of a githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining her people - if they do not execute her first. Lae'Zel is first met very early on your playthrough: You'll find her for the first time during the Prologue aboard the Nautiloid. After completing the first section of the ship, while you are walking outside she will jump over you just before the first fight. She will leave your party at the end of the Prologue and must be recruited again in the Ravaged Beach. To do this, you must explore the starting area near the Cathedral Ruins until you find her being held prisoner. Free her to recruit her for your party. See Lae'Zel's Location on the BG3 Map. Should you set camp before encountering Lae'zel, she will free herself and attempt to find her kin on her own. As a result, she can be found talking to / dead near the Githyanki raiders (This may depend on number of long rests taken). Should you defeat the raiders and Lae'zel survives, or you revive her afterwards, she will offer you another chance to join forces.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II : During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - \"source of my bruises\" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue. After passing a DC 16 Persuasion or Intimidation check (the outcome of your duel has no effect on the choices), she will kiss you whenever you want.

One of Shar's dark disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret to uncover.

WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED", "How to Romance Shadowheart in BG3 : In this Shadowheart Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Shadoweart's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship.", "BG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act II : Act II will eventually bring you to the Silent Library in the Gauntlet of Shar. As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind. This will turn into the final intimate scene where you and your lover will enjoy each other's company as you skinny dip in the calm waters.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Approval Guide : If you are looking to befriend or romance Shadowheart, you will have to get her approval up. Companions are not black and white in BG3, but they have some characteristics you can consider when forming your party and making game choices.\n\nShadowheart Inspiration Guide : All characters can gain Inspiration based on their Background when your party completes content in a specific way.

As the Location's name suggests, a couple of events that take place during the corresponding Quests and objectives within will inevitably affect Shadowheart, as she is a loyal follower of Shar. At some point in the dungeon, you'll come across a Statue of Shar that you can have your Companions pray to. Doing so with Shadowheart will have her reaffirm her belief in Shar, declaring that she will give the entirety of her heart and soul to Shar from then on. It is yet unknown if this means that your romance with her will be put to a stop, but it's probably not advisable to risk it. Eventually, Balthazar, the main Enemy for this Quest and Location is trying to claim a sleeping entity called the Nightsong, who you'll get to reach after you get magically transported to a different realm in the depths of the Gauntlet of Shar. After successfully claiming victory against him in the ensuing battle, Shadowheart will find herself holding the Spear of Night. You will then have the choice of telling her to go ahead and kill the Nightsong, or to lower her weapon instead, which unfortunately will require a successful Charisma check with a DC of 20. As you can imagine, either choice will have large consequences for the world of the game, which may include effects on your relationship with Shadowheart. Killing the Nightsong results in Shadowheart truly embracing her role as a chosen of Shar and having no more time or energy to spare loving anything or anyone else. Successfully sparing the Nightsong will eventually allow you to convince Shadowheart to leave behind the Shar. To do this, simply go with the dialogue option that will continue your relationship whenever the choice presents itself. The transition will be hard on her, but your support through the difficult time will allow your romance to grow stronger. The Nightsong will also reveal herself to be a daughter of Selune and will have answers to the question of Shadowheart's lost past. While it is again not certain whether killing the Nightsong will put an end to your romance with Shadowheart, it is probably not advisable to risk it.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act III : As mentioned, following this route will have Shadowheart turn away from her devotion to the Shar. Following the important, irrevocable decision to spare Nightsong, She will instead be blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. This will cause her to be forsaken by the Shar, thus her eventual decision, helped by your convincing, to leave this loyalty behind. Nightsong herself will reveal herself to be Dame Aylin, daughter of the moon goddess. After progressing in Act III, and keeping your relationship with Shadowheart going, Aylin will eventually tell you what she knows of Shadowheart's past, including why she has an aversion to swimming. Some more time later, your romance will culminate with a scene that starts with receiving an invite for you to swim with her, as a symbol of her leaving her life as a chosen of the Shar behind.

You can do so as early as the Nautiloid when you run into her, but you'll have to save her at the Ravaged Beach when she gets captured by Tieflings. This will begin his quest: The Githyanki Warrior   WARNING MASSIVE SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  \n\nHow to Romance Lae'zel in BG3  : In this Lae'zel Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Lae'zel's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game.  Lae'zel's personality can be described as loud, direct, and bloodthirsty. She doesn't hold back in expressing her thoughts and preferences. She enjoys dominating others and is inclined towards violence and insults. Her focus is primarily on the mission at hand, and gaining her approval involves rejecting distractions and roundabout ways of achieving objectives, even if it was to avoid bloodshed, to avoid getting sidetracked. For her, it's crucial that she handles all Githyanki-related matters her way, and she has pride in her race and their standing. She will approve of antagonizing Shadowheart and often goes against her preferences, though they occasionally find common ground. This effectively means any decisions that agree with Shadowheart will gain her disapproval, while the opposite will always win approval from her.  To gain Lae'zel's approval, one must align with Githyanki principles and ideas. For example, she will dislike exploring alternative methods of removing the tadpole and will always have some side remarks about how only Githyanki methods will resolve your collective tadpole problem. In general, whenever any chances to agree with pro-Githyanki statements present themselves, you should take it if you want to get on her good side. It can be viewed that she values duty above all else, and might disapprove of unnecessary shows of weakness, something she might share with Astarion, especially if it makes completing the task at hand take longer. Gaining approval from Lae'zel can be more challenging than other Companions, as a lot of times the choices she will approve of will not align with the general good. As such, players have taken to avoid disapproval events by keeping Lae'zel away from certain dialogues, either by leaving her in camp or keeping her at a distance.  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Lae'zel can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind, and eventually getting her approval high enough, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Lae'zel, if when you talk to her at the camp, after yet another remark about the Githyanki method being the more reliable way to fix the tadpole problem, rather than the Druid Halsin's (depending on where you are in Act I), you'll have the option to ask her if she's been looking at you differently of late. She'll finally confess that she is starting to see you in a different light. She'll openly say that she wants you. After this dialogue, you'll just have to rest at your bunker. Lae'zel will come to visit you for your first steamy intimate encounter. Try to keep an open mind!  \n\nBG3 Lae'zel Romance Guide Act II : During a long rest, Lae'zel may challenge you to a duel.If you win the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to tell her that she is yours.If you lose the duel, Lae'zel will ask you to say that you are hers.Either way, she will call you zhak vo'n'ash duj - \"source of my bruises\" - and you can now ask for a kiss during dialogue.

This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills.

This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Shadowheart's approval centers around respecting her privacy and boundaries, as she values secrets and rewards curiosity. Although she may not openly show it, she appreciates actions that benefit others and actions motivated by self-interest. Being a member of the Trickery Domain, she admires the use of wit and cunning to resolve situations and approves of the player engaging in such actions, rather than brute force. Additionally, her mastery over secrecy, stealth, and deceit leads her to favor players who exhibit similar skills. Any time the player passes skill checks in persuasion, deceit, religion, or insight, they will also impress Shadowheart and boost her approval of the player. Players should avoid engaging in unnecessary cruelty, as she strongly detests such actions. Being needlessly cruel is a surefire way to lower her approval, although she may be open to certain morally ambiguous actions if they can be justified. Additionally, following Lae'zels suggestions or prioritizing her opinions and suggestions over Shadowheart's will also lead to disapproval. In general, you'll have to embrace Shadowheart for who she is, regardless of how people fear her or shy away from her, and be patient about her opening up to you.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Shadowheart, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with her further and further. These can be things like places that she likes to visit, and gifts that you could give her, like the night orchid which is her flower of choice and can be found in the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.  \n\nBG3 Shadowheart Romance Guide Act I : Your relationship with Shadowheart can officially begin during Act I even before the Quest Save the Refugees, unlike how it was in Early Access. Keeping the general guidelines above in mind and eventually getting her approval up, players may approach her at the camp for a talk. At this point, your approval rating with her should be High so try to explore and do a lot of other things before tackling the Quest for more chances to get your approval up, if it's still lacking at this point. You're on the right track with Shadowheart, if you can choose the dialogue option where your character says, \"I can't help but feel like you and I might have missed a chance to connect. Truly connect.\" when they talk to her. This can be hard to catch as the option is just lumped together along with other options that usually show up when you try to talk to Shadowheart at the camp. Choose the appropriate response after she pushes forward her idea for an intimate moment alone. Afterward, head to your bedroll and interact with it to see that you have a choice to go to bed alone or to find Shadowheart. By clicking on Shadowheart, players share a moment with her at the cliffside. You can be a bit more forward with your dialogue choices during your time alone with her, but still, keep the same guidelines in mind in order to secure the romance path. When she asks you about yourself, the Persuasion roll dialogue option will not ruin anything if you succeed it. When she tries to share about herself but says she can't, she'll appreciate it if you don't pry further. As previously mentioned, anything you've managed to make her open up about at this point will help with regard to dialogue choices. Eventually, you both will lie down on the rocks, and choosing the next two appropriate dialogue choices for a moment will lead to your first kiss and officially begin your relationship."], "mode": {"py/id": 8}, "metric_dict": {"mrr": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}, "hit_rate": {"py/object": "llama_index.core.evaluation.retrieval.metrics_base.RetrievalMetricResult", "py/state": {"__dict__": {"score": 1.0, "metadata": {}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["score"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}}}, "__fields_set__": {"py/set": ["retrieved_texts", "query", "expected_texts", "mode", "metric_dict", "expected_ids", "retrieved_ids"]}, "__private_attribute_values__": {}}}]}
