Why are Races Important in BG3? : When choosing your Race and Subrace some factors to look at such as the different dialogues and the element of role-playing, but the most important component is the Racial Features. First, it's important to mention that in the full release of Baldur's Gate 3, Ability Score Points for Races that were present in Early Access have now been removed, giving the player complete freedom to choose the race they want that better correlates with the selected Class. Moving forward, these Ability Score Points instead are now associated with the class players will choose. Take the time to read the description for each Race and Subrace you'll select to better understand its Racial Features. For example, some races such as Elves or Gnomes have Darkvision, allowing the character to see clearly in dark areas. This a very useful feature for new players as you will tread multiple locations and most likely fight enemies in the dark. Another factor to consider when it comes to Racial Features is movement speed, and in Baldur's Gate 3, some races are capable of moving farther than others in combat. An example would be choosing a race with great movement speed if you are playing a class that excels in melee combat, this way, you can reach and attack your targets easily without wasting a turn.  Mechanical Considerations: Pay attention to the racial traits, abilities, and proficiencies that come with your chosen race. These can complement your class and playstyle. Think about how your race's attributes align with your desired character build. For example, if you plan to play a melee fighter, a dwarf's natural resilience and weapon proficiencies may be advantageous. Racial Proficiencies are another factor to consider when choosing your Race in Baldur's Gate 3. A good example is for some players, who choose to play as a spellcasting class like Sorcerer, Wizard, or Warlock, but they want to be able to wield melee weapons such as Shortswords or Longswords. Selecting races such as the Githyanki provides proficiency in wielding the said weapons, making your character proficient in using spells and melee weapons. Races and Subraces provide a selection of traits, and racial features, including proficiencies, base speeds, night vision, and more. Race choice in Baldur's Gate 3 will also make a difference in your dialogue options, NPC interactions, treatment, and race-unique scenes. These are some of the things that players would want to consider during character creation if they are going for a specific playstyle.
