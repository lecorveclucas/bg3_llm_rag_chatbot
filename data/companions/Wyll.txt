How to Romance Wyll in BG3 : In this Wyll Romance Guide, we explore the general path toward gaining Wyll's approval and what opportunities you have to share some moments with her. This will be updated as more is revealed throughout the game. Gaining Wyll's approval centers around doing good, righteous acts, and protecting and saving those in need. He also has a bit of a soft spot for people who've made questionable deals with questionable people or patrons, out of necessity, just as he has as a Warlock with his patron Mizora. Naturally, acts that are in contract with righteousness, good, and justice will meet be largely met with his disapproval. Additionally, his context as a tortured soul trapped in a contract that's largely to his disadvantage will grant you approval whenever you express your willingness to help him, regardless if it's in helping him execute missions and requests given by his patron, or in making efforts to figure out a way to get him out of his contract.  As with all the Companions, whenever you can talk to Wyll, always scour the dialogue options for any new options, again still following the general guidelines above, where she'll slowly open up to you about things that will help you deepen your bond with him further and further. Anything you find out about might also appear in dialogue choices during intimate moments, which will allow you easier choices if you're afraid to mess up.

BG3 Wyll Romance Guide Act I : Wyll joins the party during Act I once the player reaches the Druid Grove. After he joins in the fight against the Goblins looking to infiltrate the grove, players can get the scene of Wyll officially joining once they start exploring the Tiefling camp. By talking to him in camp soon after, players can speak with him to get a little peek at his context and learn of his current mission to hunt down Karlach. Eventually, you can have Karlach join your party and clear out the misunderstanding between them. At camp, you'll meet Mizora, Wyll's devil patron who set him on the hunt for Karlach in the first place. For refusing to kill Karlach, Mizora turns Wyll into a devil himself. As you progress through the first act, continue racking up approval points with Wyll to at least the green part of the approval bar which can be checked when looking at his character sheet. If done so, players will have the chance to get a kiss from him after rescuing the Grove and defeating the Goblin Camp leaders. It is very important to note that if you choose to help Minthara and the Goblins instead and kill everyone in the Grove, Wyll will heavily disapprove and permanently leave the party. On the hero route, you can speak to Wyll at the party. You can choose to straightforwardly tell him that you want to dance with him or imply that you went to see him for a reason. From there you can choose the obvious choices to show him that you like him, or you can even try to do a Persuasion check and ask him for a kiss, which he'll relent to if you pass the check.

If your approval with Wyll is high enough, you can speak to him at camp to find him practicing a dance. You'll score more approval if you try and entertain his request to dance with you. Afterwards, you'll do a partner dance and you'll have another chance to kiss Wyll at the end of it. You can ask him to spend the night with you but he'll reveal his inclination for traditional romance and insist that he wants to do this all the proper way with you.
