Jaheira : Jaheira is a potential Companion in Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3). Companions assist the player by joining their party and have their own backstories and unique characteristics. They all have their own Classes and starting equipment. Some of the companions can also be selected in the Character Creation screen, allowing players to play from their point of view. Jaheira is not available as an Origin character, but rather as a party member.   This city is a blight on the landscape. Better to have let the land grow wild. Jaheira can be found at Last Light Inn in Act 2. She will initially serve as an NPC but, depending on player choices, join the party as a companion. During the assault on Moonrise Towers, Jaheira will lead the Harper charge on the main building. Once the first floor is cleared, players can ask her to join them in the fight against Ketheric Thorm. She will help during the initial fight atop Moonrise Towers, and can be further persuaded to join the final confrontation against Thorm inside the nautiloid. Once the fighting is over, players can ask her to join them permanently as a companion.
