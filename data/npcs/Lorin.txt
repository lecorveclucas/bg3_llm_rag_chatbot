Lorin Dialogue Options : When you first encounter Lorin, he is doing his best to not look directly at you. He has been cursed by Auntie Ethel, and is condemned to see what is to come all the time, living trapped in an alternate reality where the future is already happening. He pleads constantly not to be hurt, and even sees you as a Mind Flayer already. Players can Roar as one to scare him, this earns the approval of Shadowheart, Lae'zel and Astarion.  Talk to him after the hag is dead, with someone else than your main character, and he will react and talk in a more calm way. Its  not known why.  He is not confirmed to appear later.
