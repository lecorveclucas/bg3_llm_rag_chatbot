If Gandrel is left alive, he might track Astarion to your camp, depending if you said that you know about Astarion, but you did not reveal where he was. Players can decide to leave him be in his search for Astarion, or even reveal Astarion if he is in your party. Note that if players don't reveal Astarion during this conversation, you won't be able to do it later on. Players can trade with Gandrel: he sells Arrow of Fire, Arrow of Acid, Potion of Healing and, obviously, Garlic.
