Alfira Dialogue Options : You can encourage Alfira to finish her song, and later invite her to your camp for a victory party (if you side with Tieflings.)If you use Speak with Animals spell to talk to the squirrels in front of her, you will hear some funny comments. Approach Alfira and she will be mid-song.  Stay silent and listen.What's that tune you're singing? .How can I put this? That sounded a little unpolished. .Leave.  Converse with her and you may have additional options: Let me see if I can help. .That's the creative process for you. Agony and ecstasy. Mostly agony. .Why are you songwriting now? Hardly the best time.You'd better swap that lute for a weapon. You'll need one, soon enough. .Leave. If you offer your assistance she will offer her second lute.  First things first what's the song about?.Hand me that lute. We can perform together. .Leave If you ask what the song is about, she will talk about her teacher. You can try to continue to inspire her encourage her to keep going from here and she will continue the song and a scene will play. You can choose to skip at any time.  Telling her to hand you the lute allows you the option to perform with her, triggering two performance checks: one with a DC 15 followed by a DC 10. Passing both checks grants the character performing proficiency in Musical Instruments. (Note: this does not give you proficiency in the Performance skill, but does allow you to attract a crowd by playing an instrument or whistling.) Doing so grants you a legendary lute, but you do not get the cutscene of her performing the finished song.

Alfira Notes and Tips : If you wish to spare her reliably from the Dark Urge's killer instinct, simply walk across the bridge leading to the Blighted Village from the Emerald Grove Environs Waypoint then return to the Druid Camp and knock her out with nonlethal damage. Long resting after this should trigger the camp scene with her replaced by a silver dragonborn bard.
