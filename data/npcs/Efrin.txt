Efrin Dialogue Options : Efrin is petrified when you first enter the gallery of the Overgrown Tunnel. If players decide to kill Auntie Ethel, he will turn back to normal again. Apparently, Efrin was petrified by the hag because he was dying from a mortal disease called Laduger's Bite. But if you manage to pass an Arcana check, you can reveal that he was actually sickened by Ethel herself. He will thank you and leave to reunite with his family.You can remove Efrin's Petrified status by throwing Basilisk Oil at him before dealing with Ethel. In the pre-release, he flees the Overgrown Tunnel without providing a dialogue option.However, in the full release, if the Petrification is dispelled, Efrin screams in pain before expiring on the cave floor.(It is unknown if he appears later in the storyline.)
