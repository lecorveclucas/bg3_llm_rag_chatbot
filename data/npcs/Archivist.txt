Archivist Notes and Tips : Upon reaching the western portion of the House of Hope, use the hatch to enter the dungeon. Hope will tell you about the Archivist. Pass the skill checks here to learn that the Archivist is afraid of Zariel's inquisitor, Verillius Receptor. This gives you a dialogue option to pretend as the inquisitor, which means the Archivist won't bother you.Talk to the Archivist to get an invitation to enter the Boudoir. You can now pass through the Mystic Force Curtain. The pool inside can reinvigorate the team (work as long rest).
