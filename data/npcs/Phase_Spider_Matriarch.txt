Notes and Tips : Sleep spell works good with the spiderlings.You can destroy the other spiderling eggs to prevent her from spawning more spiderlings. The ones on the far platform from her are fairly easy to sneak to without detecting - be sure to equip the Spiderstep Boots on the person sneaking to prevent detection! She will still be able to hatch the ones she starts by, but it makes things a lot easier in the last half of the battle.While attacking or destroying the closest clutch of eggs near the Matriarch will aggro the boss, by destroying all the eggs by sneaking before starting the fight and starting the actual fight by using a Fireball on the Matriarch and the last clutch of eggs closest to it is a relatively easy method of getting the achievement "Pest Control".Destroying the web bridges the Matriarch is standing on will result in fall damage.If you don't care about the robe/loot she drops you can use a gravity pushing spell, thunder arrow, etc. To push her off in to the green cavern belowâ€¦ Instant kill. Also, shoving her down the central cavern hole now causes her lootable corpse to be found in the Underdark at the spot where you land if you feather fall down the hole.
