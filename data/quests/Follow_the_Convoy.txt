Follow the Convoy Walkthrough : Arriving at the Shadow-Cursed Lands, you'll come across a Cutlist Camp, speak to the Goblin (X:158 Y:-29) who mentions using a torch to keep you safe from the shadows. There is a brazier nearby with some torch, light the brazier and the torch before heading further. You also want to make sure you have the lyre instrument from Minthara, you'll need it to summon the drow. Make your way down the path where you'll see some supplies and crates from the camp, you'll know you're near when you hear another member from the camp (X:84 Y-53). Speak to Warrior Gronag and then Kansif. Do not attack Kansif, simply choose a dialogue how you want to answer, and in the end, you'll have the option of: [PERFORMANCE] Pluck a tune.Wait here. I'll return.Attack. Choose the first dialogue and your character will have a DC of 16 for Performance. Regardless if you pass or fail, you'll be able to summon Kar'niss the drider. Speak to him and tell him to guide you towards Moonrise Towers. Make sure you stay close to Kar'niss to protect yourself from the shadows, the lantern he is holding repels the dark forces around. As you follow the rider, you'll stop by an abandoned building where you'll be ambushed by Harpers. You'll have a choice of defending the convoy or turning against the Drider. At this point, we recommend that you defend the guide and the convoy to protect your cover as a True Soul. Choosing the option of "Defend the caravan, attack the Harpers" grants approval up towards Astarion and approval down towards Gale and Karlach. Simply defeat the Harpers and after the battle, continue following Kar'niss until you reach the destination which completes this quest.
