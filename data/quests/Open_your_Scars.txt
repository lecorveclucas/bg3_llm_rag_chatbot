Open your Scars Objectives : Kressa the Myrkulite necromancer patched you together... you were a tadpoled wreck down in this fleshpit. Nearly dead, head half-caved in. She said you were the first ever tadpoling victim. You're either one-in-a-million unlucky, or someone hated those stinking guts of yours to do such filthy work. Bloody vengeance seems appropriate.
