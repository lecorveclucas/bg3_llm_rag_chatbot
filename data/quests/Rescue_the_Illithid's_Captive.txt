Rescue the Illithid's Captive : Rescue the Illithid's Captive is a Quest in Baldur's Gate 3. Rescue the Illithid's Captive can be acquired during Act 1 and is a part of the prologue. Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earning more loot and experience to become more powerful.   

Rescue the Illithid's Captive Objectives : We encountered a survivor, trapped inside one of the pods aboard the nautiloid. Perhaps we can find a way to free her.
 Once you have the Eldritch Rune return to the pod in which Shadowheart is trapped and insert the rune into the console located on its right side. If you successfully pass the dice roll check then Shadowheart will get out of the capsule and you will be able to talk to her.
