Get Help from Healer Nettie Objectives : Aradin told us that the druid Halsin has an apprentice. If we can find her, she might be able to help us with the parasite.
When we asked about healing, we were told to look for Nettie in the Inner Sanctum..There's a camp nearby where someone named Nettie can supposedly heal any wound. She might be able to help remove the parasite.
We told Nettie about the parasite. She seemed concerned and asked us to follow her to another room for treatment.
Unable to heal us, Nettie spared us the horror of ceremorphosis - by poisoning one of us with deadly venom. We need to cure the poison immediately..Nettie's corpse told us of a cure - the Elixir of Silvanus. It seems related to flora of the Dalelands..To make the lifesaving antidote, we need to mix a bundle of mugwort in a cauldron of theriac, blessed by Silvanus.
We managed to find a cure for the venom Nettie used - but we're still no closer to a cure for the parasite..We rescued Nettie's master, Halsin. Now that he's safe, we don't need to ask Nettie for help - we can go directly to the master druid instead..Nettie was killed before she could help us. We'll need to find another way to cure ourselves..Nettie's dead - serves her right for trying to poison us. But it's a bittersweet victory: we still need to find a way to deal with the parasite..We left the area without seeing if the druid apprentice could heal us.
