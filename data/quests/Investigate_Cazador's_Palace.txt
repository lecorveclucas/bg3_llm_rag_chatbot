Investigate Cazador's Palace Walkthrough : Continuing north to Gur Camp (X:93 Y:-18), you witness an ongoing mini ceremony. These individuals are a tribe of Monster Hunters, similar to the ones encountered in Hag's Swamp. Ulma halts the ceremony to approach you. She discloses her search for Astarion and initiates a conversation:
What's your interest in Astarion?.If you're looking to burn him on the pyre, I'm in favor..We're not interested in your affairs.
Choose the first option, and Ulma explains that Astarion took their children during his last visit. However, she notes that circumstances have changed: Astarion severed ties with his master and the binding spell. Astarion adds his perspective, and you can reply:
Yes, Astarion is free now..It was luck more than skill..Why do you care about this matter?
Opt for the second choice, and Ulma acknowledges their misfortune. Despite their efforts to rescue the children from Cazador Szarr's well-guarded palace, they've been unsuccessful. Ulma speculates that if one of his offspring approached, he might believe he could control Astarion, thus allowing his entry. Astarion disputes this, knowing Cazador's merciless nature. He's convinced the children are deceased. You can interject with:
We'll do our best to save them..You might be right, but it's worth trying..How can you be so certain, Astarion?
Select the third option, prompting Astarion to explain his history of offering victims to his master over the past two centuries, resulting in their consumption on the same night. Ulma persists, urging you to rescue them or seek vengeance. Respond with:
If Astarion won't assist, I will..Astarion owes them revenge at the very least..There's nothing more to discuss if we can't help.
Choose the second option, leading Astarion to agree. This update progresses the quest "A Pale Elf." and "Investigate Casador's Palace".

Upon arriving at Wyrm's Crossing, X:-13 Y:58, proceed to Fraygo's Flophouse, X:-16 Y:76, where a cutscene unfolds featuring Dalyria and Pale Petras engaged in a dispute about securing more marks for their master during the Black Mass. Pale Petras reveals that the other mark is designated for himself, granting him freedom after the Master's approval. Suddenly, Astarion intervenes, his sarcasm evident as he questions if Cazador truly promised them freedom and whether they believed such a pledge. Dalyria expresses astonishment at Astarion's return, given his previous freedom. You have the option to step in with:
Our objective is to eliminate Cazador. Only then can you gain your freedom..Provide us with information about the ritual. What do you know?.Hold your tongue.
Opt for the second choice, and Pale Petras assumes that Astarion's return indicates his desire to ascend alongside them. Astarion's anger flares at Petras, and he curses at him. He seizes Petras, issuing threats. Dalyria pleads with Astarion to stop. You can respond with:
Speak or suffer the flames. The choice is yours..Say nothing..[Persuasion] Astarion, Stop!
Choose the first option, and Dalyria discloses that the Master is preparing the Black Mass in a tainted chapel beneath his palace. Astarion releases Petras, resolving to thwart Cazador. Petras expresses astonishment, questioning Astarion's transformation. Astarion cryptically states that he has evolved beyond his former self, unafraid of anything. The sun's constraints and Cazador's influence no longer bind him. He asserts his unique capability to confront Cazador. Astarion instructs them to leave, and they vanish abruptly. Respond to Astarion with:
I commend your compassion for sparing them..They might alert Cazador to our approach..We should have eliminated them.
Upon selecting the second option, Astarion concurs, acknowledging their likely warning and resultant trepidation. He empathizes with their coerced compliance under Cazador's will. He references Seven Sigils held by seven spawns, with Cazador in possession of six. Confronting him becomes imperative to seize the power. Your response can be:
Sacrificing your siblings? Are you willing?.Why not maintain distance? Cazador's ritual hinges on finding you..'Ourselves'? Perhaps you mean yourself..At times, your intimidation surpasses the elder brain's..Let's proceed.
Opt for the third choice, and Astarion concurs. He asserts that by augmenting his power, the entire team benefits. He queries if you remain steadfast. Respond:
We're a team. I've got your back..What if this is a trap?.I'm uncertain..Shall we go? We've obtained what's needed – the ritual's location beneath the palace.
Choosing the second option prompts Astarion to assert that collectively, you will address the situation.
