Help Kith'rak Voss Walkthrough : Help Kith'rak Voss takes place during Act 3. Talk to Lae'zel, she I'll say she wants to speak with Kith'rak Voss at Sharess' Caress. Voss can be found inside a room on the third floor of Sharess' Caress next to Raphael. Once Voss leaves the room, starts the new Deal with the DevilQuest (This doesn't deviate us from our main mission).Once we finish Raphael's Quest, we meet Voss again on the second floor of Sharess' Caress. The outcome of this interaction varies based on whether you accepted Raphael's contract or not. If you agree to Raphael's terms and sign the contract, he'll drop the Orphic Hammer. Presenting it to Voss and agreeing to liberate Orpheus will conclude the quest, earning you the Silver Sword of the Astral Plane.Refusing Raphael's Contract: Declining the contract doesn't preclude obtaining the hammer, albeit through a significantly more challenging route. You must infiltrate Raphael's House of Hope, his residence, and steal the hammer. However, this entails confronting and defeating Raphael, widely regarded as one of the toughest adversaries in the game. Instructions on accessing the House of Hope are provided below.Meet Voss at The Sewers and show him the hammer, and if you signed Raphael's contract, the interaction proceeds similarly as before, resulting in the acquisition of the Silver Sword.
