Help Omeluum Investigate the Parasite Objectives : We mentioned the parasite to Blurg, a hobgoblin. His colleague, a mind flayer named Omeluum, offered to examine it. Perhaps it can cure us?
The mind flayer couldn't extract the parasite, but offered us a way to negate the magic protecting it.
To help us, Omeluum requires a Tongue of Madness mushroom and some Timmask Spores. We can find both of these in the mysterious tower nearby..We found the Tongue of Madness. We'll need to bring it back to Omeluum along with the Timmask Spores..We found some Timmask Spores. We'll need to bring them back to Omeluum once we find the Tongue of Madness..We lost some of the mushrooms that Omeluum asked for. We'll have to find some replacements before it can help us..The tower belongs to a cleric of Mystra named Lenore. She is fond of gardening and experimenting on plants such as the Susser Tree.
Before Omeluum can start the procedure, we'll need to drink a potion it made from the mushrooms we found. 
The potion Omeluum gave us only made the parasite stronger - unlocking a strange, new power. To calm it down, Omeluum is willing to trade us a Ring of Mind-Shielding. 
We've acquired Omeluum's Ring of Mind-Shielding. It might protect its wearer from the parasite's influence.We left the area before Omeluum could help. We'll need to find a cure somewhere else..We picked a fight with the Society of Brilliance - Omeluum won't be helping us now..Omeluum died. We'll have to keep looking for a way to deal with the parasite.
