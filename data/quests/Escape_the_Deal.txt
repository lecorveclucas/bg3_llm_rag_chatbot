Completing Quests allows players to learn more about the world and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, as well as earn more loot and experience to become more powerful.   

Escape the Deal Objectives : We signed Raphael's deal but are having second thoughts about giving the ultra-powerful Crown of Karsus to a devil. Raphael is smart, but perhaps he can be outsmarted: if we could get into the House of Hope and destroy our contract, that would void the deal.
