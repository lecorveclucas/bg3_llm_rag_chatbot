After agreeing to help Sovereign Glut, you will now go to seek the Duergar threatening the peace of the Myconid Colony.   In the Decrepit Village at (X:15 Y:-179) a Duergar will spot you and take you to Gekh Coal who is ready to fight after you get caught sneaking. Attempting the Persuasion (Charisma) will require you to pass a DC check of 15. I could've killed you before you even noticed me, but didn't.

You can decide if you want to give the boots and tell him that you have it, or do it at a later time, or simply attack him here. If you have decided on how to proceed with this, make sure to walk towards (X:23 Y:-211) to discover a waypoint before moving on to the next interaction. Following this walkthrough, we will keep our word to Sovereign Glut and Thulla. You can now return to the Myconid Colony and inform Glut that the Duergar has been taken care of. He demands to see the bodies, and you can walk back to the area to show him. However, as soon as Glut sees the body he's dissatisfied and wishes to take Spaw's circle. Glut is blinded by his hunger for power and wishes to devour the colony whole. If you take Glut's side you will need to return to the colony and kill everyone including Spaw. Alternatively, you can also take Glut to Spaw and talk to the ruler of the Myconid Circle. You can then choose to announce that you will depose Spaw in favor of Glut. Then if you kill only Spaw without hurting anyone else, Glut take control of the colony and you don't have to kill anyone else. If you take Glut's side you will receive Featherlight Boots and Winter's Clutches as rewards.
