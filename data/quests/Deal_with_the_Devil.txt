Deal with the Devil Objectives : We found Raphel's servant Korrile on the ground floor of Sharess' Caress. She told us her master awaits us on the top floor.   

Deal with the Devil Walkthrough : In Sharess' Caress, proceed to another room on the 2nd floor at X:-14 Y:105 and engage a conversation with Raphael. He's pleased to see you and snaps his fingers to clear your mind. Initiate a conversation using the following responses: Did you just rid me of the tadpole with a snap of your fingers?.I feel  empty. What did you do?.Another mere trick. Show me something substantial. Choose the first option, and Raphael clarifies that your tadpole remains, but he has silenced your other guest temporarily for a private discussion. The Illithid cannot eavesdrop. Your companions raise concerns, questioning Raphael's intentions. Respond with: I trust the Illithid more than I trust you.Speak freely then - tell me why I'm here.Clever, but you initially promised a cure, not this. Opt for the second option, and Raphael affirms his commitment to his word, asserting that he'll eliminate your tadpole. He acknowledges your progress and your pursuit of confronting the elder brain. He hints that you possess the means to destroy it. Inquire: The Astral Prism?.The Emperor?.Orpheus? Select the third option, and Raphael confirms your suspicion. He explains that he can offer a solution to set Orpheus free. Respond with: Continue.Orpheus' guards tried to kill me - he's dangerous.Why would I want to free him? Opt for the third option, and Raphael sarcastically wonders if you prefer indulging in the Emperor's tentacles. He elaborates that Orpheus could ally with you against the elder brain, since you share an enmity with it. Express your thoughts: Based on what I've seen, Orpheus is my adversary, and the Emperor is my ally.The Emperor is the reason I'm alive.Fine - explain how I can free him. Choose the first option, and Raphael attempts to convince you of your gullibility. He asserts that you're merely a tool for the Emperor's agenda, transporting it to the elder brain. While Orpheus might cooperate initially, if he resists, you might have to eliminate him. Reply: The risk is worth taking. How can I free Orpheus?.I'm convinced. Tell me the method to liberate Orpheus.We're done here - I'm departing. Opt for the first option, resulting in two updated quests "Free Orpheus" and 'Deal with the Devil" in your journal. Raphael discloses that the Orphic Hammer is an artifact capable of breaking Prince Orpheus' chains, secured at the House of Hope. Respond with: Perfect - hand it over.Seems too convenient to be true.How convenient that you possess exactly what I need. Select the third option, and Raphael suggests the convenience could extend to your offering something in return. Reply: What's your desired gain from all this?.You probably want my soul for the Hammer, right?.Just reveal your demands.I won't negotiate with you, Raphael. Choose the second option, and Raphael discloses that he desires something more valuable: the Crown that controls the Elder Brain. Respond with: I'm intrigued - explain your eagerness for the crown.What exactly is this crown?.Handing over such a potent artifact to a devil seems risky.No. Opt for the first option, and he speaks of power, tracing his longing for the Crown back to when Archwizard Karsus created it, leading to the fall of the Netheril empire. Raphael was present at its demise. He explains that anyone who possesses it can ascend to godhood. His goal is to rule the Nine Hells with its power. This advances the "The Wizard of Waterdeep" quest. Reply with: The thought of you ruling the Nine Hells isn't comforting.You'd make an excellent Archdevil Supreme.How can you be confident in using the Crown where Karsus failed?.Why didn't you seize the crown earlier?.I'll take the crown and wield its power myself. Choose the third option, and Raphael states his immortal nature prevents failure. Reply with: If you're incapable of failing, why couldn't you obtain the Crown before?.The notion of you ruling the Nine Hells isn't reassuring. Opt for the first option, and he explains that Mephistopheles, one of the Archdevils, sealed the Crown in one of his vaults. Raphael awaited an opportunity, and when the Chosen's actions brought the crown into play, he seized the chance. Reply: It must irk you that mortals managed to steal the crown while you couldn't.How did the crown end up with them?.How can you be certain I'll secure the crown? Choose the first option, and Raphael agrees, frustrated by the mess they caused. He outlines the deal: when you vanquish the Elder Brain, bring the Crown to him, and he'll exchange it for the hammer. Choose: I accept the terms. Where do I sign?.I'd rather destroy the crown than risk its misuse again.Once I possess the Netherstones, I'll control the Crown myself.No deal, Raphael - I'm leaving. Select the fourth option and depart. You don't need to accept Raphael's offer to free Orpheus. Simply sneaking into House of Hope and steal the hammer will do (Free Orpheus). If you regret signing a contract with the devil, you can steal your contract as well.
